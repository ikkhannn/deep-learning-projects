## BINARY CLASSIFICATION PROJECT - MINES VS ROCKS
We will discover how to effectively use the Keras library in your machine learning project by working through a binary classification project step-by-step.

By the end of this project , we will know ,
•	How to load training data and make it available to Keras.
•	How to design and train a neural network for tabular data.
•	How to evaluate the performance of a neural network model in Keras on unseen data.
•	How to perform data preparation to improve skill when using neural networks.
•	How to tune the topology and configuration of neural networks in Keras.

### STEPS OF PROJECT
1. Build a baseline model
2. Tuning Layers and Number of Neurons in The Model
3. Evaluate a Smaller Network
4. Really Scaling up: developing a model that overfits
5. Rewriting the code using the Keras Functional API
